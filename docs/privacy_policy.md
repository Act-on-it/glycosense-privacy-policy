# Privacy Policy — GlucoSense - Diabetes Tracker

Effective date: February 1, 2026

Thank you for choosing GlucoSense - Diabetes Tracker ("we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, and the choices you have. Please read it carefully before using the app or providing any personal information.

## 1. App overview

GlucoSense - Diabetes Tracker helps users analyze food photos to provide nutritional insights and personalized dietary guidance. The app supports user accounts (including Google Sign-In), image uploads for food analysis, personalized recommendations, push and local notifications, in-app purchases/subscriptions, and advertising for monetization.

## 2. Information we collect

- **Account information:** When you sign up (including via Google Sign-In) we collect your name, email address, and any profile data you provide.
- **Health & fitness data you enter:** Weight, height, diabetes status, blood sugar values, HbA1c, activity level, diet preferences and other health-related information you enter into the app. This is sensitive information — you choose to provide it and it is used to deliver personalized recommendations.
- **Photos / Images:** Images you upload or select for food analysis are uploaded to our Firebase Storage and may be processed by third-party AI services to generate analysis results.
- **Usage and device data:** Device identifiers, OS version, app usage, analytics events, and performance data (collected by Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics) to help us improve the app.
- **Diagnostics & crash logs:** Collected automatically by Crashlytics to debug and improve stability.
- **Payment and subscription details:** When you purchase or subscribe we use a third-party service (RevenueCat) to process and manage subscriptions; we may receive purchase receipts and subscription status.
- **Push notification tokens:** For Firebase Cloud Messaging so we can send you notifications and reminders.
- **Files you choose to upload:** Files selected via the file picker (e.g., images) are uploaded to Firebase Storage.

## 3. How we use your information

- Provide and maintain the app features and personalized recommendations.
- Process and analyze images to generate nutritional insights.
- Process payments and manage subscriptions.
- Send transactional messages and notifications (reminders, important updates).
- Improve app performance and fix bugs using analytics and crash reports.
- Serve and personalize advertisements (AdMob) where applicable.

## 4. Sharing and third parties

We share data with the following third parties for the purposes described:

- **Firebase / Google Cloud Platform:** We use Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Storage, Analytics, Crashlytics, Remote Config, Messaging) for hosting, storage, authentication, analytics, notifications, and server-side logic.
- **Google Sign-In:** If you sign in using Google, certain profile information is shared with us according to Google's OAuth flow.
- **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):** For serving ads and ad personalization. Ad providers may collect device and usage information to deliver relevant ads.
- **RevenueCat (purchases_flutter):** For subscription and purchase management. We share purchase receipts and subscription status with RevenueCat to manage entitlements.
- **OpenAI (or other AI provider):** Images uploaded for food analysis are stored in Firebase Storage and the image URL may be sent to the OpenAI API (or another AI image-analysis service) to generate nutritional analysis. This means image content and any text prompts used for analysis are transmitted to that third party and processed according to their privacy practices.
- **Other service providers:** Cloud Functions, file storage, analytics or monitoring providers that help operate the app.

We do not sell your personal information.

## 5. Image uploads & AI analysis

When you upload an image for food analysis:

- The image is uploaded to Firebase Storage under a path tied to your account.
- We send the image URL and analysis prompt to an AI service (OpenAI) to perform image understanding and generate the nutrition results displayed to you.
- The AI provider will process the image according to their privacy and data retention policies. Do not upload images that contain highly sensitive personal information.

## 6. Ads and personalization

We may display ads using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). Ads may be personalized using device and usage data. To opt-out of personalized ads, you can follow your device settings or use Google’s ad settings: https://adssettings.google.com (or contact us for additional options).

## 7. Payments and subscriptions

We use RevenueCat (and the platform billing systems) to handle in-app purchases and subscriptions. We may store purchase receipts and subscription status in our backend (Firestore). We do not store full payment card details — payment information is handled by the platform store and RevenueCat.

## 8. Security

We use industry-standard security measures (transport encryption, access controls) to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If you have concerns, contact us.

## 9. Data retention

We retain personal and usage data as long as needed to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You may request deletion — see Section 11.

## 10. Children

The app is not intended for children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, contact us to request deletion.

## 11. Your choices and rights

## 12. International transfers

Your data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place (for example, using services from reputable providers who adhere to international standards).
